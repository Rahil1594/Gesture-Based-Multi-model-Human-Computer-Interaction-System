##PROBLEM STATEMENT : Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application that uses computer vision techniques to enable various interactions with the computer, including hand gesture-based volume control, virtual mouse control using hand movements, eye-controlled mouse movement and clicking, and capturing and displaying images from the webcam.


## About the project

The system increases accessibility and user experience greatly by allowing people to control and interact with computers through gestures, thus providing an alternative to traditional input devices. It also has the potential to empower people with motor disabilities by giving them more independence and access to digital resources.
